            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>6 slices bacon, cut into lardons</li>
                <li>3 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>3 pounds stewing beef, cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
                <li>1 large carrot, sliced</li>
                <li>1 large white onion, sliced/li>
                <li>3 cups red wine, like a chianti</li>
                <li>2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups beef stock</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
                <li>2 cloves smashed garlic</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon thyme</li>
                <li>1 crumbled bay leaf</li>
                <li>18 to 24 small pearl onions</li>
                <li>3 1/2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 herb bouquet (4 sprigs parsley, 2 sprigs thyme, 1 bay leaf)</li>
                <li>1 pound fresh white mushrooms, quartered</li>
            </ol>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>STEP 1</li>
    <li>Simmer bacon lardons in 4 cups water for 10 minutes (Lardon is the French 
        culinary term referring to thin strips of bacon, cut approximately 1/4-inch
         thick). Drain and pat dry.</li>
    <li>STEP 2</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 450°F. In a large Dutch oven, sauté the bacon in 1 tablespoon 
        of oil for about 3 minutes, until it starts to lightly brown. Remove with a 
        slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
    <li>STEP 3</li>
    <li>Dry the beef with a few paper towels for better browning. In batches, sear 
        the beef on all sides in the Dutch oven. Set aside with the bacon.</li>
    <li>STEP 4</li>
    <li>Back in the pot, add the sliced carrots and onions; sauté in fat until browned, 
        about 3 minutes. If there's any excess fat, drain it now.</li>
    <li>STEP 5</li>
    <li>Add the bacon and beef back to the pot. Season with 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/4 
        teaspoon ground pepper. Toss. Sprinkle with flour and toss once more. Place in the
         center of the oven for 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>STEP 6</li>
    <li>Remove pot from oven; toss beef and place back in the oven for 4 more minutes. Remove
         the pot from the oven and reduce the heat to 325°F.</li>
    <li>STEP 7</li>
    <li>To the pot, add the wine and stock. The liquid should barely cover the meat and vegetables.
         Add the tomato paste, garlic and thyme. Bring to a light simmer on the stove, then cover
          and simmer in the lower part of the oven for 3 to 4 hours, or until the meat is easily pierced.</li>
    <li>STEP 8</li>
    <li>In the last hour of cooking, bring 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and 2 teaspoons oil to a medium heat in
         a sauté pan. Add the pearl onions and toss around in the fat until they've browned, 10 minutes. 
         Then stir in 1/2 cup beef stock, a small pinch of salt and pepper and the herb bouquet. Reduce 
         the heat to low and simmer the onions for about 40 minutes, until the liquid has evaporated,
          and the onions are tender.</li>
    <li>STEP 9</li>
    <li>Remove the onions and set aside. Discard the herb bouquet and wipe out the skillet. Add the remaining 
        butter and oil and bring to a medium heat.</li>
    <li>STEP 10</li>
    <li>Add the mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes, shaking the pan to coat with the butter.</li>
    <li>STEP 11</li>
    <li>Place a colander over a large pot. Drain the beef stew through the colander and into the pot.
        Place the pot with the sauce over a medium heat and simmer for about 5 minutes, skimming any
        fat on top. Pour the beef and vegetables back into the Dutch oven. Add the pearl onions and 
        mushrooms to the pot. Pour the sauce over the beef mix and simmer an additional 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>STEP 12</li>
    <li>Add cream to the beaten egg whites.</li>
    <li>STEP 13</li>
    <li>Pour over the gelatin layer.</li>
    <li>STEP 14</li>
    <li>To serve, garnish with strawberries, if desired.</li>
